# idle_boss_fight

A project made for the Mintbeans hackathon. The challenge of the project is to make a simple IDLE game using javascript in 4 hours.

Click the buttons to increase your power to defeat the bosses and ang money and skill points to defeat bosses even faster.

The idea is that you get addicted by simply watching numbers grow.
